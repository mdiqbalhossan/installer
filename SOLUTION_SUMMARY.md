# Solution Summary

## Problem Fixed
Users were unable to install the package using `composer require softmax/installer` and received the error:
```
Could not find a version of package softmax/installer matching your minimum-stability (stable).
```

## Root Cause
The repository had no stable release tags, so Composer could not find any stable versions to install.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Stable Release Tag
- Added `v1.0.0` tag to mark the current state as a stable release
- Tagged the latest commit that includes documentation updates
- Added comprehensive tag message describing all features

### 2. Updated Documentation
- Enhanced README.md with alternative installation instructions
- Added PACKAGE_RELEASE.md with maintainer instructions
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with proper release date

### 3. Installation Instructions Added
For users encountering stability issues:
```bash
# Primary method (works after tag is pushed to GitHub)
composer require softmax/installer

# Alternative if stability issues persist
composer require softmax/installer:^1.0
```

## Next Steps for Maintainer
To complete the fix, the repository maintainer needs to:

1. **Push the tag to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Ensure Packagist registration:**
   - If not already registered, submit the package to Packagist
   - If already registered, the webhook should automatically detect the new tag

3. **Verify installation:**
   - Test `composer require softmax/installer` works without version constraints
   - The package will now resolve to the stable v1.0.0 release

## Files Modified
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added proper release date for v1.0.0
- `README.md` - Enhanced installation instructions
- `PACKAGE_RELEASE.md` - Added (new file with release notes)
- Git tag `v1.0.0` - Created stable release marker

This minimal change approach solves the core issue while maintaining backward compatibility and providing clear documentation for users.
